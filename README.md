# customer churn prediction using machine learning 
I am excited to share my recent project on customer churn prediction using artificial neural networks (ANN). In this project, I aimed to understand and predict why customers leave an organization by analyzing various features such as gender, tenure, churn history, and more.

To ensure accurate and reliable predictions, I started by performing extensive data preprocessing. This involved handling null values, addressing data quality issues, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis. Additionally, I employed data visualization techniques to uncover valuable insights into the relationship between churn and tenure, enabling businesses to identify patterns and trends.

By analyzing the reasons behind customer attrition, I provided businesses with actionable insights to make informed decisions and develop effective retention strategies. Understanding the factors that contribute to churn is crucial for organizations to proactively address customer needs and enhance customer loyalty.

To build a predictive model, I tackled the challenge of class imbalance in the dataset by applying various sampling methods. This ensured that the model is trained on a balanced representation of both churned and non-churned customers. Leveraging the power of artificial neural networks, I created a simple yet efficient model that can learn complex patterns and make accurate predictions.

During the model development process, I carefully selected appropriate activation functions and loss functions to optimize the model's performance. By fine-tuning these parameters, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 95%, indicating the model's ability to accurately predict customer churn.
